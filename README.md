# Zomboid Vanilla Map Cells Exports
Public repository for the vanilla PZ map, sliced into 300x300 cells for the base map, and veg map.

Pre-zipped downloads are in the "Zip Downloads" folder, wheras the "Files" directory contains the folders and files for each cell, organized based on cell designation. The contents are organized as the Row number first, with folders inside it corresponding to the cell itself. Each folder has 2 files for that particular cell; so there will be a folder named 22x, and inside you would have, for example, 22x22, which will contain 22x22.png, and 22x22_veg.png.

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out!
